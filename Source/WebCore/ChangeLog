        [LBSE] Activate LBSE for <rect> painting
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=236194

        Reviewed by NOBODY (OOPS!).

        Finally activate LBSE for <rect> elements -- painting <rect> elements
        now works as expected in LBSE. Try using MiniBrowser and switch
        from legacy engine to LBSE and back -- this now works just fine and
        rebuilds the render tree / updates display.

        Covered by existing tests, no change in behaviour.

        Make input element UA shadow tree creation lazy
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=236747

        Reviewed by Aditya Keerthi.

        We currently delay InputType creation for parser inserted elements until
        just after the attributes have been set, so that we don't wastefully
        create an InputType and the UA shadow tree creation if a non-text
        type="" was specified on the tag. We don't do anything similar for
        script inserted input elements. We could make the InputType creation
        lazy, but most of the wasted time is due to the shadow tree creation.

        This patch makes InputType shadow tree creation lazy by delaying it
        until one of the following happens:

        1. the element is inserted into the document
        2. the type="" or value="" attributes are changed before the element
           is inserted into the document
        3. any DOM methods that need access to the innerTextElement() are
           called on the element before the element is inserted into the
           document

        Not all places where we call innerTextElement() on the
        HTMLInputElement are safe to lazily create the shadow trees, so we
        have two accessors:

        - innerTextElement() returns the inner text element if it's been
          created already
        - innerTextElementCreatingShadowSubtreeIfNeeded will perform the lazy
          shadow tree construction if it hasn't already been done

        Since the existing
        createShadowSubtreeAndUpdateInnerTextElementEditability function has
        more responsibility than just creating the subtree and ensuring the
        editability is set appropriately, it's renamed to a more manageable
        createShadowSubtree.

        This change is a 0.5% progression on Speedometer 2.
